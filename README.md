> Traditionally considered a homogeneous cell type, hippocampal pyramidal cells have been recently shown to be highly diverse. However, how this cellular diversity relates to the different hippocampal network computations that support memory-guided behavior is not yet known. We discovered that the anatomical identity of pyramidal cells is a major organizing principle of CA1 assembly dynamics, the emergence of memory replay, and cortical projection patterns. Segregated pyramidal cell subpopulations encoded trajectory and choice-specific information or tracked changes in reward configuration respectively, and selectively routed these representations to different cortical targets. Furthermore, distinct hippocampo-cortical assemblies coordinated the reactivation of complementary memory representations. These findings reveal the existence of specialized hippocampo-cortical subcircuits and provide a cellular mechanism that supports the computational flexibility and memory capacities of these structures.
